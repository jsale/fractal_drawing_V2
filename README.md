# Fractal Drawing Program V2
A browser-based creative tool for drawing generative art inspired by fractal mathematics and other natural patterns. This application allows users to create complex, organic-looking structures like trees, ferns, and snowflakes, and combine them with freeform paths and cloud textures.

## Features
 This application is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the HTML Canvas for rendering.
### Multiple Drawing Modes:
- Fractal Tree: Procedurally generates trees with adjustable branch levels, length, angle, and randomness.
- Barnsley Fern: Renders the classic Barnsley fern fractal with controllable point density and scale.
- Koch Snowflake: Creates snowflake patterns with adjustable iteration and size.
- L-System Flower: Draws delicate, flower-like structures based on an L-system algorithm.
- Perlin Noise Vine: Generates wandering, organic vine shapes using Perlin noise.
- Clouds: A stamp-based tool for adding soft, cloud-like textures.
- Path Tool: A freeform drawing tool for creating simple lines and dots.
- Eraser: Erases any content on the canvas.
### Advanced Object Control:
- Branch Selection: In Tree mode, click any branch to select its entire "level" across one or all trees.
- Color & Alpha Control: Modify the color and transparency of selected branch levels.
- Per-Object Transparency: Set a global transparency value that applies to all newly created objects.
- Customizable Color Palettes: Features two color modes for non-tree objects: a single color picker or a palette that cycles through colors.
### Animation & Interactivity:
- Wind Animation: An optional "Gentle Sway" animation that brings fractal trees to life.
- Full Undo/Redo History: Every drawing, erasing, and color modification action is tracked and can be undone or redone.
- Playback Feature: Replay the entire drawing process from the beginning, with adjustable playback speed.
### Exporting:
- Save as PNG: Export the entire canvas as a single PNG image.
- Export Layers: Save the background, ferns, and other objects as separate transparent PNG files.
- Export as SVG: Generate a scalable vector graphic (SVG) of the artwork.
